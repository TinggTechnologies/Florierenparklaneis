          <p data-aos="fade-up" style="line-height: 1.6;"><br>
            Prospective pupils/students are required to purchase registration forms in the school at the designated places. The form must be duly filled and returned to the school for necessary action. Therefore, entrance examination must be written to determine the child's ability and the appropriate class. <br /><br />
            After relevant admission tests, successful students are invited in company with their parents for oral interview. This is done to know their academic background, potentials and future aspiration. <br />
            Interaction with parents at this stage is aimed at knowing their children's educational background, health and other challenges( if there is any) and their capability to sustain the child through school. <br />
            Selection is strictly on the basis of success in the written examination and the oral interview.<br /><br />
            Evidence of full payment of all necessary fees is the guarantee for admission after successful performance in examination and subsequent interview.
