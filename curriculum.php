            <p data-aos="fade-up">At Life Moulders, we run a full, balanced and extensive curriculum designed in phases to cover the Pre-school level (Age range 2-5), Elementary level ( Age range 5-11) and Secondary level (Age range 11-17). Our curricular activities are arranged towards ensuring that students are taught essential skills that will help them to become lifelong learners. While the curriculum for the Junior level is wholly Nigerian, the Senior Secondary level is enriched such that our students will be able to write SSCE, NECO, GCSE and SAT. The under-listed are the subjects offered.

             <p>
             Although our school adopts the Montessori approach to learning, our activities are designed in ways that support every child’s uniqueness to learn best. Daily activities, transitions and routines are tailored to have impact on the child’s physical, social, intellectual and language development through hands-on trial and error, learning by doing, play, sensory exploration and having positive role models to watch and imitate.
