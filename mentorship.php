            <p data-aos="fade-up">At Florieren ParkLane, we invest time and energy in helping our students to cope with a lot of challenges which teenage life presents. Through our mentoring sessions we are able to give instructions and information that helps them to make positive lifestyle choices. We use Peer Mentoring Model(older students) and volunteer staff that are trained for that purpose. Our staff receive regular training on how to develop a helpful relationship based upon mutual trust and respect with the students. Sometimes the school uses structured learning method under the programme to encourage a desired behaviour or correct a negative behaviour among the students.<br /><br />
             The results of this programme has been awesome. We have witnessed improved academic performance among underachievers, increased self esteem among students,also helped students overcome behaviour problems and help new arrivals to properly and quickly settle down in school.
